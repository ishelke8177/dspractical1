This client-server application allows the client to send messages to the server, and the server responds by echoing the received messages. The server listens on port 5000 for client connections. When a client connects, the server creates input and output streams for communication. The server reads the client's messages, logs them, and sends back a response. The client connects to the server using the server's address and port. It reads user input, sends the messages to the server, and displays the server's responses.

To run the application, compile both Server.java and Client.java files separately using javac command, and then run the Server and Client classes in separate terminals or command prompts.

Note: Ensure that you have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed and properly configured on your system.
